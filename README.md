# TempoGeist

## Project Overview

TempoGeist is an ambitious project under development, aiming to redefine the integration of AI/ML tools within the realm of real-time musical collaboration. Our vision is to create a predictive and generative AI/ML tool that excels in real-time MIDI note prediction and streaming latency remediation, harnessing the power of MIDI 2.0's enhanced capabilities.

## Project Goals

- **Real-Time MIDI Prediction**: TempoGeist will feature a concurrent stream of predictive MIDI data, powered by sophisticated AI/ML algorithms that adapt based on real-time user inputs and historical data.
  
- **Latency Remediation**: With a focus on individual user experiences, TempoGeist will predict and adjust MIDI notes to compensate for input latency, ensuring a seamless creative flow.

- **MIDI 2.0 Integration**: By incorporating MIDI 2.0's expanded expressiveness and precision, TempoGeist will offer a tool that is both highly responsive and nuanced in its musical predictions.

- **DAW Compatibility**: Designed to run in the background, TempoGeist will integrate with a variety of Digital Audio Workstations, enhancing the music production process without disrupting the artist's creative intent.

- **User Input Priority**: TempoGeist respects the artist's control, allowing for real-time user input to override any predictive data, ensuring that the final musical output remains true to the artist's vision.

## Development Status

TempoGeist is in the alpha stage of development. We are diligently working on incorporating MIDI 2.0 features to ensure TempoGeist is a cutting-edge tool for musical innovation.
